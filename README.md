# asvz-signup

Not user friendly but does the job.

Fill in `params.json` and run `sh asvz.sh`.

You might need to install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (`brew install jq`).

### Params to set
- `id`: 6-digit id of the class you want to sign up to. You can find it in the url of the class page.
- `time`: when you want your signup request to be sent, specified using the format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss".
- `token`: you know what this is.

Shoutout to [Milos](https://github.com/mmalesev) for helping.
